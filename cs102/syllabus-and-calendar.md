#Course CS-102 : Object Oriented Programming and Application of Data Structures & DBMS (Java)

###Target Students 
Students of Mumbai University currently studying (or will get) in 3rd semester of Computer Science or Information Technology.

###Pre requisite
- Hands on experience of any Structured Programming Language.
- Basic problem solving skills. 

###Objective:
- Learn concepts of object-oriented programming
- Knowledge and skills in OO design and program development
- Building OOP application using Java.
- Learn to use various Data Structures and RDBMS in project development.
- Understanding basic principles, processes and tools of collaborative programming (coding ethics, versioning systems, testing, documentations, discussion and presentations)

###Duration: 
- Classroom Session: 8 sessions on Sat of 3 hrs. each (Total 24 hrs.)
- Lab Session: 8 sessions on Sun of 3 hrs. each (Total 24 hrs.)	

###Methodology:
- __Experiential process:__ The students will learn by experience instead of informative lectures. Professionals will guide the whole learning and allow students to explore and generate many possibilities.
- __Application Oriented:__ Application took center stage. It is important to know _‘the context for the content’_ to make content relevant. Skills learned in the classroom are immediately applied to a realistic setting (in project development). 
- __Project driven:__ The teaching process will be ,
	1. Through developing a project in Classroom sessions (aka **Classroom Project**). 
	2. Followed by Lab sessions, where students (in teams/pairs) will practice by developing a separate project chosen by them (aka **Self Project**). 

###Course Structure
####Session 0: (offline session, 8-10 days before Session 1)
- **Assignment**
	- Students will be given a programming assignment 'Assignment-0' in structured programming language (i.e. C). (The assignment will be such that which is quite difficult to implement in C but would be relatively easy with OOPS)
	- Need to submit in 4-6 days, i.e. 4 days before Session 1.
        - Review and revert with feedback on Assignment-0 with in 2 days to the students via email. 

####Session 1: 
- **Saturday**
        - Introduction to Abstraction, Object & OOPs.
        - Introduction to Java classes, attribute and methods.
        - Java environment (JDK, JRE and JVM), PATH & CLASSPATH env. variables, compiling and running programs via command prompts.
        - Implement the Assignment-0 using Java. Includes Java Objects and references.
	- Abstraction and Encapsulation in detail. 
	- _Class Project_: Announce and explain Classroom Project. 

- **Sunday**
	- Assignments to practice learning of last lecture, 'Assignment Set-1'.
        - _Self Project_: 
		1. Ask the students to form a team of 4-5 members/team (preferably 4) and give a name to it.
		2. Announce the team to figure out their Self Project topic. 
		3. They will have to submit 3 topics by Wednesday, in precedence, out of which they will be assigned one.
		4. Explain them 'Points to remember' while selecting the topics
			- The scope of the project should be adequate w.r.t. time.
			- Project should not be based on Internet, n/w programming, mobile devices (eg: library mgmt instead of online library).
	- _Home Assignment_: Finish the remaining programs of Assignment Set-1 and submit by Thursday. 
	
- *Backend prep* (tasks to be done by Blue Cocoon, before the next lecture)
	- After the teams submit their Self Project topics, assign one project to each team and finalize their scope. Make a plan of implementation based on learnings in each session.
	- Review the Assignment Set-1 and submit the feedback. 
	- Test for bugs in Assignment Set-1 and send them the Bug Report. (This will become the basis for introducing the importance of Test Cases or TDD in forthcoming lecture)

####Session 2: 
- **Saturday**
	- Introduction to test cases through Assignment Set-1 problems.
	- Java Basics contd.
- **Sunday**
	- Announce the Self Project for each team. (Lab faculty will be available to clear their doubts and guide them)
	- Development of _Self Project_:
		1. Identify classes, methods and attributes.
		2. Implement simple methods.
	- _Home Assignment_: Further implement simple methods by dividing the work to each member. Mail their assignment before the next lecture.
- *Backend prep* 
	- Create Git repositories for teams and grant access to all members. 
	- Mail the Self Project topic, feedback and schedule to each team which will align with the learning in each Classroom session.

####Session 3:
- **Saturday**
	- Java Basics contd.
	- Access Control
	- Exception Handling
- **Sunday**
	- Refactoring: for access control and error handling.
	- Further development on Self Project.

- *Backend Prep*
	- Monitor project and test case development.

####Session 4: 
- **Saturday** 
	- Inheritance
		1. Is-a relationship
		2. Method overloading
		3. Method overriding 
		4. Attribute hiding
		5. Constructor chaining
	- Implementing Stack, Queues.
	- Introduction of Collections framework.
	- Introduction to Versioning System (Github desktop client)
- **Sunday** 
	- Move team project to Github repositories.
	- Refactoring: Inheritance and using Data Structure.
	- Further development on Self Project.

- *Backend Prep*
	- Monitor project and test case development.

####Session 5 
- **Saturday**
	- Polymorphism
	- Programming to Interface
	- Casting

- **Sunday**
	- Refactoring: polymorphism and programming to interface.
- *Backend Prep*
	- Monitor project and test case development (feedback on refactoring).

####Session 6: 
- **Saturday**
	- Introduction to Garbage Collector.
	- File Handling
	-  __Debugging__ (using debugger)
- **Sunday**
	- Using files in their project

- *Backend Prep*
	- Monitor project and test case development.

####Session 7:
- **Saturday**
	- DBMS (Mysql)
	- JDBC Drivers
	- Using Mysql through Java.
- **Sunday**
	- Using DBMS in their project
	- Refactoring to replace files with DBMS (DAO layer)

####Session 8: 
- **Saturday**
	- Mock presentations and tips
- **Sunday**
	- __Project Demo__


***Note:***

1. *Communication with students will be  verbal and via email, to help them understand the communication techniques.*
2. *Every student will have to revert via emails for each project deliverables initially and later (post Session 4) need to commit them in Git.*
3. All the documentation is inline i.e. using Java Docs.
4. IDE (i.e. Eclipse) will be used right from Session 1. Initially it will be used as a text editor and gradually use it as IDE.
