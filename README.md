#Blue Cocoon Courses

All the courses in Blue Cocoon are designed to complement the current technical education with practical and application oriented learning. The idea is to make curriculum studies more exciting and relevant for students, without adding much burden on them. 

The courses focuses on the fundamental knowledge and skills. It involves current generation technologies used in development of professional and enterprise applications. The course will be delivered only by experienced and knowledgeable professionals.

###Methodologies
- __Experiential process:__ The students will learn by experience instead of informative lectures. Professionals will guide the whole learning and allow students to explore and generate many possibilities.
- __Application based:__ Application took center stage. It is important to know ‘the context for the content’ to make content relevant. Skills learned in the classroom are immediately applied to a realistic setting (in project development). 
- __Project development:__ All the teaching will happen
	1. Through developing a project in Classroom sessions (aka **Classroom Project**). 
	2. Followed by Lab sessions, where students (in teams/pairs) will practice through developing a separate project chosen by them (aka **Self Project**).
