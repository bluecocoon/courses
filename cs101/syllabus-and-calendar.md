#Course CS-101 : Problem Solving using Structured Language (C)

###Target Students 
Students of Mumbai University currently studying (or will get) in 2nd semester.

###Pre requisite
Nothing

###Objective:
- To identify the problems and learn classical problem solving strategies.
- To understand of the role computation can play in solving problems.
- To solve problems using a programming language (C).
- To experience basic process, tools, techniques, documentation and team activities involved during project development.

###Duration: 
- Classroom Session: 8 sessions on Sat of 3 hrs each (Total 24 hrs.)
- Lab Session : 8 sessions on Sun of 3 hrs each (Total 24 hrs.)
	

###Methodology:
- __Experiential process:__ The students will learn by experience instead of informative lectures. Professionals will guide the whole learning and allow students to explore and generate many possibilities.
- __Application based:__ Application took center stage. It is important to know ‘the context for the content’ to make content relevant. Skills learned in the classroom are immediately applied to a realistic setting (in project development). 
- __Project development:__ The teaching process will be ,
	1. Through developing a project in Classroom sessions (aka **Classroom Project**). 
	2. Followed by Lab sessions, where students (in teams/pairs) will practice through developing a separate project chosen by them (aka **Self Project**). 

###Course Sturcture
####Session 1: 
- **Saturday**
	- Identifying the day-to-day problems in real life scenario and define them. 
	- Solve the problems using flow chart as a language.
	- Solve some hypothetical and imaginary problems using flow chart.
	- _Home Assignment_: Identify or imagine 5 problems in real world scenario, define and solve them using flow chart. 

- **Sunday**
	- Discuss few Home Assignments in detail (can take 8-10 such problems) and give proper feedback.
	- _Home Assignment_: Improve the home assignments and mail to the faculty by Thursday. 
	- Make teams of 3-4 students (or pair programming) and every team will choose a problem statement (can be from home assignments) they are willing take as _Self Project_. They can mail it with flow chart by next day.
	
- *Backend prep* (tasks to be done by Blue Cocoon, before the next lecture)
	- After the team submits their problem with its flow chart, develop a proper mini project from each statement and make a plan of implementation based on learning in each session.

####Session 2: 
- **Saturday**
	- Declare the _Classroom Project_ to be developed while learning through the course.  Make flow chart for the project by discussing with the students. 
	- Announce the _Self Project_ assigned to teams for them to implement in the Lab sessions.

- **Sunday**
	- Teams will make flow chart for their _Self Project_. ( Lab faculty will be available to clear their doubts and guide them)
	- _Home Assignment_: Submit the flow-charts of _Self Project_ by Thursday.

- *Backend prep* 
	- Go through the flow charts of teams and give your feedback on it to make it proper. Also make a schedule for implementation, which will align with the learning in each Classroom session. 
	- Mail the feedback and schedule to each team.

####Session 3:
- **Saturday**
	- For problem solving;
		1. Explain computer as a platform - Hardware and OS 
		2. Programming language (C) as a tool (language)
		3. Introduce them with compiler and IDE 
- **Sunday**
	- Computer hardware practical session. Assembling a system. Touch Typing session etc.

####Session 4: 
- **Saturday** 
	- Top-down design model and role of modules (functions) in structured programming. ( Explain function ‘as a self contained block of code with a specific purpose’.)
	- Programming language grammar and vocabulary (BNF & C constructs)
		- Expressions
		- Input & Output
		- Variables, Data types & type conversion
		- Assignment statement 
		- Scope and life time
		
- **Sunday** 
	- Practice by given assignments and implementing in _Self Project_.

####Session 5 
- **Saturday**
	- Control statements
	- Iteration (loops)
	- Functions & parameters 
	- Introduction to recursive functions
	-  Introduction to **Versioning System**

- **Sunday**
	- Practice by given assignments and implementing in _Self Project_.

####Session 6: 
- **Saturday**
	- Arrays, Strings & Structures
	- Pointers
	-  __Debugging__ (using debugger)
- **Sunday**
	- Practice by given assignments and implementing in _Self Project_.

####Session 7:
- **Saturday**
	- Pointers revisited
	- Dynamic Memory Allocation
	- Files
	- __Functional Testing__
- **Sunday**
	- Practice by given assignments and implementing in _Self Project_.

####Session 8: 
- **Saturday**
	- Mock presentations and tips
- **Sunday**
	- __Project Demo__


***Note:***

1. *Communication with students will be both verbal and via email, to help them improve their communication skills.*
2. *Every student will have to revert via emails for each project deliverables initially and later (post Session 5) need to commit them in Git.*
3. *Projects developed by students will be tested and their test plan will be reviewed every week to find bugs. Students need to fix those bugs. It will provide them with close to real project development challenges and experirnce*
